## Overview

Faircamp is a [Static Site Generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator) dedicated to music producers.

With this package, Faircamp will automatically regenerate ([using Systemd Path Units](https://www.putorius.net/systemd-path-units.html)) your website if any change is made to your sources.

Alternatively to this package, you can [install Faircamp on your computer](https://simonrepp.com/faircamp/manual/installation.html) and use its rsync feature (ith the `--deploy` or `--deploy-destination` options) to send the builded website to a [My Webapp](https://apps.yunohost.org/app/my_webapp) folder on your YunoHost server.


**Shipped version:** 1.0.0~ynh2
